## Introduction

This was built live on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/trash_dev) so it is far from perfect.

This is a monorepo containing both the client site(documentation) and the graphql server.

You can also view the live [documentation](https://narutoql.com/docs)

## Getting Started

Make sure you have docker installed.
`docker-compose-up` (Note: slow reload times on node app (~5s) somebody help? Client reloads fine)

**Alternatively,**

`npm run dev` in `src/client` to run [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) app

`npm run dev` in `src/server` to run [Express](https://expressjs.com/) app
